    "To perform the above given task, we will leverage Foursquare API to gather the information of all neighborhoods in NYC. Information will include each neighborhood's latitude, longitude and most common venues. The most important features we will be extracting from the API response is the number of theaters and hotels in common venues by any given neighborhood.\n",

    "In other words, we will Analyze the data for neighborhoods with most theaters and least hotels as laid forth by our clients in their primary requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also harvest the data from various studies and reports done by nyc.gov and nycgo.com on trends and analysis on Hotel Industry in New York City.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Week 2 of this project, we will dig deeper into Modeling, Visualizing, Deployment and Customer Feedback, so stay tuned..."
